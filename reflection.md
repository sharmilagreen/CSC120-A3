I consulted with Aimen and Anna Feuer on this assignment, and went to TA hours on 4/8/25. I felt comfortable with Java, as its the programming language I have the most experience in. Java feels very different to me from Python, though looking back on this assignment there are simpler ways to have done this assignment that are more python-esque in terms of syntax. I would recommend that future students revisit this assignment as one of the harder ones and rethink how to make their code simpler with their new tools they've learned in class.
